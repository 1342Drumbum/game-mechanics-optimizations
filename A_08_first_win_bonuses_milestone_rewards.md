## 8. First Win Bonuses & Milestone Rewards

**Psychological Hook:**

First-time bonuses create achievement peaks that punctuate progression. "First boss kill: +500 currency" delivers dopamine spike. Milestones (10 wins, 50 wins, 100 wins) create checkpoint goals.

Diminishing returns maintain engagement: first win = 500, second = 100, subsequent = 50. Frontloads rewards for hook, then maintains baseline. Prevents exploitation (first win farming) while rewarding genuine progression.

**Implementation:** Track unique achievements (first boss kill, first character unlock, first difficulty tier). Award 3-10× normal rewards on first completion. Add long-term milestones (10/25/50/100 victories) with exclusive cosmetics/titles.

**Examples:**

**1. Hades:** First Darkness earn = 50 guaranteed minimum. First victory = 300+ bonus (vs 150 avg). First god boon = 50D bonus. First weapon unlock = 100D. Frontloaded rewards create strong Day 1 hook. First 10hrs earn 3000D, next 10hrs earn 1500D (normalized).

**2. FTL:** 8 ships unlocked via achievements. Kestrel (starter), Engi (have Engi crew reach sector 5), Federation (have 6+ crew), Zoltan (have Zoltan crew reach sector 5), Mantis (defeat Mantis ship without crew deaths), Slug (beat game with Kestrel A/B). Each unlock = 5-15hrs. Each ship = new 10hr mastery curve.

**3. Slay the Spire:** Heart unlock requires beating game on Ascension 20 (all characters). First Heart kill = Eternal One achievement (Steam: 1.2% of players). Requires 200-400hrs mastery. Ultimate milestone for hardcore players.

**4. Vampire Survivors:** First 10-minute survival = unlock new weapon. First 15-min = character. First 30-min victory = stage unlock. Milestones every 5min in early game create rapid progression hook. Later milestones: 50 victories, 100 victories (cosmetics).

**5. Dead Cells:** Boss Cell milestones. First 0BC victory = unlock 1BC difficulty (+rewards, +difficulty). 1BC victory = 2BC. Continues to 5BC (extreme). Each BC tier: 20-50hrs for casual players. Total: 150+ hours across all BC tiers.

**Success Metrics:** First-time bonuses should be 3-10× normal. Milestone spacing: 1-2hrs (early) → 5-10hrs (mid) → 20-50hrs (late). Completion milestones (10/25/50/100 wins) maintain long-term engagement. Cosmetic rewards at high milestones prevent pay-to-win while rewarding dedication.

**Synergies:** Achievement Systems (#35), Milestone Unlocks (#6), Meta-Currency (#2)

**Session vs Meta:** 40% Session (earn in-run), 60% Meta (milestone tracking)
