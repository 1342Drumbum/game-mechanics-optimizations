## 7. Incremental Stat Upgrades (Mirror/Totem Systems)

**Psychological Hook:**

Incremental upgrades create reliable progression independent of RNG. "+1% damage per upgrade, 50 upgrades = +50%" is deterministic comfort against RNG failure. Ensures "no zero-reward runs"—even bad RNG earns currency toward permanent power.

Small increments mask large cumulative effects. "+2% damage" feels minor, but 25 upgrades = +50% = massive. Players underestimate compounding: 1.02^25 = 1.64× (64% increase), exceeding additive perception.

**Implementation:** 15-25 upgrade paths, each 5-10 ranks. Costs scale (50, 100, 200, 400, 800). Total: 50-200hrs completion. Each rank: 0.5-2% power increase. Include build variety (offense vs defense paths, playstyle variants).

**Examples:**

**1. Hades Mirror:** 35,365 Darkness total, 26 skills, 5-10 ranks each. Shadow Presence: 150D for +50% backstab (5 ranks). Death Defiance: 1,530D for 3 extra lives (crucial survivability). Olympian Favor: 2,750D for +40% boon rarity. Average run: 105D. 337 runs = 80-120hrs. Power growth: 2-3× stronger fully upgraded.

**2. Rogue Legacy:** Manor upgrades across 9 categories. HP (15 ranks, +5 HP each = +75 HP). Damage (+% per rank). Crit chance (+1% per). Gold gain (+10% per). 60 total upgrades, costs scale exponentially (100g → 50,000g). Total gold needed: ~1.5M gold. 40-80hrs completion. Each heir stronger than last.

**3. Spelunky 2:** Shortcut construction. Tunnel 1 (skip to 1-4): costs 2000g, 1 bomb, 1 rope. Tunnel 2 (skip to 2-1): 10,000g, 3 bombs, 3 ropes, 1 key. Tunnel 3 (skip to 4-1): 50,000g, 10 bombs, 10 ropes, 2 keys. Cumulative: 15-25hrs. Enables challenge speedruns.

**4. Rogue Legacy 2:** Soul Shop with 80+ permanent upgrades. Equipment weight (carry more items), HP/Mana pools, damage types, utility unlocks. Costs scale to 999,999 gold for final upgrades. Total: 100-150hrs for maxed castle.

**5. Gunfire Reborn:** Talent system with 8 trees, 10 tiers each. +% damage, +crit, +elemental effects, +survivability. Talents cost Soul Essence (earned per run). Total: 50-100hrs for all talents. Power curve: 1.5-2× stronger fully talented.

**Success Metrics:** Each upgrade should grant 0.5-2% power increase (noticeable but not overwhelming). Total power gain fully upgraded: 50-100% stronger. Prevents meta-progression trivializing skill. Balance: upgraded veteran wins 70% vs unupgraded 40% (skill still matters).

**Synergies:** Meta-Currency (#2), Prestige Systems (#5), First Win Bonuses (#8)

**Session vs Meta:** 10% Session (earn currency), 90% Meta (spend between runs)
