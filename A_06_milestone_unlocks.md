## 6. Milestone Unlocks (Character/Weapon/Mode Gates)

**Psychological Hook:**

Milestone unlocks create anticipation through known future rewards. "Unlock character at 10 victories" creates concrete goal. Unlike abstract progression (earn 5000 currency), milestones feel achievement-based.

Unlocks expand possibility space, preventing staleness. New character = 20+ hours learning optimal strategies. Dead Cells unlocks 10 weapons in first 15hrs, creating constant novelty. By hour 40, 50+ weapons available—overwhelm becomes variety.

**Implementation:** Gate content behind performance (victories, challenges, skill mastery). Mix easy unlocks (first 3hrs) with aspirational (100+hrs). Include skill-based (beat boss without damage) and grind-based (1000 kills).

**Examples:**

**1. Binding of Isaac:** 500+ items unlocked via 637 achievements. Early unlocks: first 50 items in 10hrs. Mid: next 200 in 50hrs. Late: final 250 in 350+ hours (require Tainted characters, challenge runs, completion marks). Creates 400hr+ grind.

**2. Risk of Rain 2:** 11 characters. Commando (starter), Huntress (reach stage 3 = 1hr), MUL-T (first loop = 3-5hrs), Artificer (free 10 lunar coins = 5-10hrs), Mercenary (obliterate at Obelisk = 8-15hrs), REX (heal robot on ship = 10hrs), Loader (complete 5 teleporter events in 1 run = 15hrs), Acrid (complete Void Fields = 20hrs), Captain (beat game = 30hrs).

**3. Smash Bros Ultimate:** 82 fighters (74 unlockable). Fastest: Vs mode (10min/character = 12hrs). Slowest: World of Light story (25-40hrs). Creates variety in unlock path. Early unlocks fast (one every 10min), creating dopamine rush.

**4. Dead Cells:** 10 weapons/abilities unlocked via blueprints in first 10hrs. 50 unlocked by 40hrs. Final 145 unlocked across 150+ hours. Difficulty-gated: some require 4-5BC (hardest difficulty). Creates 200hr mastery curve.

**5. Slay the Spire:** Card unlocks tied to victories. 5 victories = unlock Ascension. 15 victories = all cards for character. 4 characters × 15 = 60 victories minimum. At 50% win rate, 120 runs × 40min = 80hrs. Unlocking fosters mastery.

**Success Metrics:** Early unlocks every 30-60min maintain hook. Mid-game unlocks every 3-5hrs. Late unlocks every 10-20hrs for hardcore retention. Achievement-gated (skill) unlocks feel earned. Grind-gated (time) unlocks feel tedious if >50hrs per unlock.

**Synergies:** Achievement Systems (#35), Challenge Modes (#22), Skill Mastery (#42)

**Session vs Meta:** 30% Session (unlock conditions met in-run), 70% Meta (long-term unlocking)
